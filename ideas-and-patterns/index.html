<h1>Ideas</h1>

<h2>1. Android Application</h2>
<p>The mobile aplication will be developed for the Android platform.</p>

<h2>2. Associated Web Site</h2>
<p>The website will be used for downloading updated information about the means
of transport and points of interest. The user (if he chooses to) will send data
about his location when in transit in order to describe the current state of
public transport and provide others with information about the tardiness of the
means of transport and related data.</p>

<h2>3. Supplimental information</h2>
<p>The user app can also receive information from other services:</p>
<ul>
    <li>weather information from <a
    href="http://wunderground.com">wunderground.com</a> for informing the user
    about what he should expect when leaving his house and when he returns;</li>
    <li><a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> for getting the events to
    which he is invited to and responding to the discution if he is late;</li>
    <li>Geocoder for getting the human address for specific coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Design Patterns</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Vertical Navigation Bar (app menu)</li>
    <li>Account Registration</li>
    <li>Lazy Registration (phone info is used if an account is not
    registered)</li>
    <li>Forgiving Format (in searching for a location)</li>
    <li>Good Defaults (when creating a route, the sleep interval)</li>
    <li>Home Link (in the various views)</li>
    <li>Event Calendar (in the next actions)</li>
    <li>Scanning Labels (on registration, login, route editing</li>
</ul>
